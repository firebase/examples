# Firebase Examples

A set of single-page examples demonstrating the use of [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com?utm_source=examples).
The following examples are included:

* [Drawing](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#example/drawing) - share a canvas with other users and draw together
* [Chat](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#example/chat) - an easy-to-integrate chatroom for your site
* [Presence](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#example/presence) - show who is available, who is idle, and who is gone
* [Leaderboard](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#example/leaderboard) - see who is winning and how it changes as scores come in
* [Multiplayer Tetris](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#example/tetris) - play head-to-head Tetris in your browser


## Getting Started with Firebase

These examples use Firebase to store and sync data. You can [sign up here for a free
account](https://www.firebase.com/signup/?utm_source=examples).


## Live Demos

All of these examples can be downloaded and run a live website in a few seconds using
[Firebase Hosting](https://www.firebase.com/hosting.html) and the [Firebase
Tools](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools). First, you need to download `firebase-tools`:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Then, choose a template from the bootstrap list:

```bash
firebase bootstrap
```

Once the template is downloaded, `cd` to the created directory and deploy to Firebase Hosting:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

You can then view the example on your web browser by running:

```bash
firebase open
```
